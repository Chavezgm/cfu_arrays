## Arrays practice

names = ["Martin","Rodrigo","Ezequiel","Bob"]
nums = [30,90,89,76]
floats_array = [12.4,3.4,60.2,34.6]
boolean_array = [true,false,true ,false]

names.push("Juan")
# This will add the name "Juan" to the list of elements in the names array 

nums.shift
# This will pull the first element in the array out, which will take 30 out

floats_array.pop
# This will pull the last element in the array which would be 34.6

boolean-array.unshift(false)
# This will add elements to the left side of the array, in this case it would add false to the left side of the boolean array.
